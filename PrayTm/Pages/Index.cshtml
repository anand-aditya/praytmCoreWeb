            <strong>What is Japathon?</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            Japathon is an initiative of ISKCON organised under World Holy Name Festival (WHNF).
            In this Japa Marathon we urge people around world to chant the Hare Krishna Mahamantra which is most effective spiritual means to connect with God
            and find spiritual realisation and bliss.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
            <strong>What is Mantra?</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            The great mantra to chant is
            "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
            Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare"
        </div>

        <br />
        <div>
            <strong>What is Round?</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            108 is an auspicious number as per Vedic tradition. When we chant Hare Krishna mahamantra 108 times preferencially on beads or otherwise it is
            called as one round
        </div>


        <br />
        <div>
            <strong>How many rounds should we chant?</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            There is no upper limit to chanting holy names. We can chant at any time of the day. ISKCON recommends chanting 16 rounds of Mahamantra those who want
            to accept spiritual initiation in it's line. But one can start with any number of rounds.
        </div>


        <br />
        <div>
            <strong> What is Japa?</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            'Japa' means personal chanting and hearing the Holy Name.
            There are no hard-and-fast rules for chanting Hare Krsna.
            The most wonderful thing about mantra meditation is that one may chant anywhere-at home, at work, driving in the car, or riding on the bus or subway.
            And one may chant at any time.
        </div>

        <br />
        <div>
            <strong>What Does The Hare Krishna Mantra Mean?</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            The mantra is a spiritual call to the Lord, meaning, “Oh energy of the Lord, please engage me in the loving service of Lord Krishna.”

            The word Hara is a form of addressing the energy of the Lord. Both Krishna and Rama are forms of directly addressing the Lord, and they mean “the highest pleasure.” Hara is the supreme pleasure potency of the Lord. This potency, addressed as Hare, helps us in reaching the Supreme Lord.
            The three words—namely Hare, Krishna, and Rama—are the transcendental seeds of the maha-mantra, and the chanting is the spiritual call for the Lord and His internal energy, Hara, for giving protection to the conditioned souls. The chanting is exactly like genuine crying by the child for his mother. Mother Hara helps in achieving the grace of the supreme father Hari, or Krishna, and the Lord reveals Himself to such sincere devotees.
